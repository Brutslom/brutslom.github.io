Hello everybody,

This is my first post in this blog, my intention is to make different posts related to pentesting, among them:

- Machine Troubleshooting:

    * HTB, Vulbhub, PentestingLab, DVWA...
  
- Attack studies on different services:

    * Active directory, apache/nginx, ...
  
- Development of pentesting tools

    * Tools that improve the pentesting process.

So far the first post I will be updating the blog every two weeks with different content that I hope can be useful to the community.

Greetings.
